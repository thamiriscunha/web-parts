# purecarousel
Pure and simple CSS3 - JS/jQuery carousel

The purpose is to be simple and lightweight.

Use:
  - Just add the script from main.js to your main js script;
  - You can modify colors and layout as you wish, but .content-carousel must be flex and its width will be given by the js code;
  - For each .content must exist a #carouselController .button;
  - In master.css there is a 'not important stuff'. Below that mark there is just style for the github page. No need to use in your project
